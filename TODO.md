- [x] way to delete notes *
   - [x] resize all the notes so that they only delete when you click an overlapping box, as currently the box is way too wide

- [x] find a better image for the eighth note as the current one is a bit thick

- [ ] rename some of the more high level variables, e.g. mainWindow, MainWindow to make them less confusing

- [ ] reformat the docstrings according to sinfield
